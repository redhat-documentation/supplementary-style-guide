[[label]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] label (noun)
*Description*: In Red Hat OpenShift, _labels_ are objects used to organize, group, or select API objects. For example, pods are tagged with labels, and then services use label selectors to identify the pods they proxy to. This makes it possible for services to reference groups of pods, even treating pods with potentially different containers as related entities.

[[latency]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] latency (noun)
*Description*: (1) In general, _latency_ is the period of time that one component in a system is waiting for another component, which is wasted time. In accessing data on a disk, latency is the time it takes to position the proper sector under the read/write head. (2) In networking, _latency_ is the amount of time it takes a packet to travel from source to destination. Latency and bandwidth define the speed and capacity of a network.

[[link-routing]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] link routing (noun)
*Description*: In Red Hat AMQ, _link routing_ is a routing mechanism in AMQ Interconnect. A link route is a set of links that represent a private message path between a sender and receiver. Link routes can traverse multiple brokers and routers. With link routing, a router makes a routing decision when it receives link-attach frames, and it enables the sender and receiver to use the full AMQP link protocol.

[[load]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] load (verb)
*Description*: (1) To "load" means to copy a program from a storage device into memory. Every program must be loaded into memory before it can be executed. Usually, the loading process is performed invisibly by a part of the operating system called the loader. (2) In programming, "load" means to copy data from main memory into a data register. (3) In networking, "load" refers to the amount of data (traffic) being carried by the network.

[[load-balancing]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] load balancing (noun)
*Description*: _Load balancing_ distributes processing and communications activity evenly across a computer network so that no single device is overwhelmed. Load balancing is especially important for networks, where it is difficult to predict the number of requests that might be issued to a server. Busy websites typically employ two or more web servers in a load-balancing scheme. If one server starts to get swamped, requests are forwarded to another server with more capacity. "Load balancing" can also refer to the communications channels themselves.

[[lpar]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] LPAR (noun)
*Description*: "LPAR" is an acronym for "logical partitioning", a system of taking a computer's total resources (processors, memory, and storage) and splitting them into smaller units that each can be run with its own instance of the operating system and applications. Logical partitioning, which requires specialized hardware circuits, is typically used to separate different functions of a system, such as web serving, database functions, client/server actions, or systems that serve multiple time zones and/or languages. Logical partitioning can also be used to keep testing environments separated from the production environments. Because the logical partitions act as separate physical machines, they can communicate with each other. Logical partitioning was first used in 1976 by IBM.

[[date-formats]]
== Date formats

Follow the _IBM Style_ guide advice of _day Month year_ for date formats, for example, 3 October 2019.

When the format _day Month year_ causes a presentation or clarity issue, use _Month day, year_ (for example, October 3, 2019) instead.

[product-names-versions-ref]]
== Product names and version references

Whenever you refer to the name of your product in full, or in its abbreviated form, or when you refer to the major and minor version of your product, avoid using hard-coded references and use attributes instead.
Only use hard-coded version references if the version that you are referring to in a particular case never changes.

=== Attribute file

Define attributes for product name and product version and store them in a dedicated attributes file for each set of product documentation.
For examples of where you can store the shared attributes file inside your documentation repository, see the link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/blob/mod-doc-repo-example/_artifacts/document-attributes.adoc[Example modular documentation repository].
Include the attributes file at the beginning of the `master.adoc` files of all titles in your documentation set:

.Example AsciiDoc: Attribute file included in a master.adoc file
[subs="+quotes"]
----
\include::__<path_to_directory_with_attributes_file>__/attributes.adoc[]
----

=== Minimum required attributes

Define attributes for the following values in each documentation set.
Note that the attribute names used in this section are only meant as examples.
You can use different attribute names:

The name of the product:: Use the product name attribute for all instances of the product name where possible.
Avoid using hard-coded product names.
For example:
+
.Example AsciiDoc: Product name attribute
----
:name-product: Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
----

The abbreviated form of the product name:: If it is necessary for your product, you can use an attribute to store a shortened version of the name of your product, for example:
+
.Example AsciiDoc: Abbreviated product name attribute
----
:name-product-abbreviated: JBoss EAP
----

The major and minor version of the product:: Use an attribute for the product version in cases where the product version can change with each release and the content is still correct.
For example:
+
.Example AsciiDoc: Product version attributes
----
:version-product-minor: 1.11
:version-product-patch: 1.11.6
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not use the product version attribute if the version should not change.
For example, if a feature was introduced in a certain version, the version should be hard-coded.
====

You might create additional attributes according to what your documentation requires.
For example, you might combine existing product name attributes to create compound names of products or components:

.Example attributes for compound names of product components
----
:name-runtime-spring-boot: Spring Boot
:name-runtime-vertx: Eclipse Vert.x
:name-spring-reactive: {name-runtime-spring-boot} with {name-runtime-vertx} reactive components
----

[[non-breaking-spaces]]
== Non-breaking spaces

Use a _non-breaking space_ (`+{nbsp}+`) between the words "Red" and "Hat". The non-breaking space prevents an automatic line break from separating the two words onto two lines. 

.Example non-breaking space
----
Before you begin to customize the installer, download the Red{nbsp}Hat-provided boot images.
----

[[single-step-procedures]]
== Single-step procedures

When a procedure contains only one step, use an unnumbered bullet.

For example:
====
* Install the `dnf-automatic` package.
====

[[user-replaced-values]]
== User-replaced values

A _user-replaced value_, also known as a replaceable or variable value, is a value that the user must replace with a value that is relevant for their situation. User-replaced values are often found in places such as code blocks, file paths, and commands.

Use descriptive names for user-replaced values and follow this general format: _<value_name>_.

[NOTE]
====
For XML code blocks, see the guidance on xref:#user-replaced-values-xml[user-replaced values for XML].
====

Ensure that user-replaced values have the following characteristics:

* Surrounded by angle brackets (`< >`)
* Separated by underscores (`_`) for multi-word values
* Lowercase, unless the rest of the related text is uppercase or another capitalization scheme
* Italicized
* If the user-replaced value is referencing a value in code or in a command that is normally monospace, also use monospace for the user-replaced value

.Example AsciiDoc: User-replaced value in a paragraph

----
Create an Ansible inventory file that is named `/_<path>_/inventory/hosts`.
----

This renders as:

====
Create an Ansible inventory file that is named `/_<path>_/inventory/hosts`.
====

To italicize a user-replaced value in a code block, you must add an attribute to apply text formatting, such as `subs="+quotes"` or `subs="normal"`, to the attribute list of the code block.

.Example AsciiDoc: User-replaced value in a code block

  [subs="+quotes"]
  ----
  $ oc describe node __<node_name>__
  ----

This renders as:

====
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc describe node __<node_name>__
----
====

[[user-replaced-values-xml]]
== User-replaced values for XML

Because XML uses angle brackets (`< >`), the xref:#user-replaced-values[default guidance] for user-replaced values does not work well for it. If you are using user-replaced values in an XML code block, use the following format: _${value_name}_.

Ensure that user-replaced values in XML have the following characteristics:

* Surrounded by curly braces and preceded by a dollar sign (`${ }`)
* Separated by underscores (`_`) for multi-word values
* Lowercase, unless the rest of the related text is uppercase or another capitalization scheme
* Italicized
* If the user-replaced value is referencing a value in code or in a command that is normally monospace, also use monospace for the user-replaced value

.Example AsciiDoc: User-replaced value for an XML element

  [source,xml,subs="+quotes"]
  ----
  <ipAddress>__${ip_address}__</ipAddress>
  ----

This renders as:

====
[source,xml,subs="+quotes"]
----
<ipAddress>__${ip_address}__</ipAddress>
----
====

.Example AsciiDoc: User-replaced value for an XML attribute

  [source,xml,subs="+quotes"]
  ----
  <oauth2-introspection client-id="__${client_id}__"/>
  ----

This renders as:

====
[source,xml,subs="+quotes"]
----
<oauth2-introspection client-id="__${client_id}__"/>
----
====

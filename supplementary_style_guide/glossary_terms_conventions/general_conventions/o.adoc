[[operator]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] Operator (noun)
*Description*: In the context of Kubernetes, an _Operator_ is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a
Kubernetes application. A Kubernetes application is an application that is both deployed on a Kubernetes cluster (including OpenShift clusters) and managed using the Kubernetes APIs and `kubectl` or `oc` tooling.

The term "Operator" in the context of Kubernetes is always capitalized to distinguish it from other types of operators, such as human or mathematical operators.

.Example: Kubernetes Operator
----
= Support policy for unmanaged Operators

Individual Operators have a `managementState` parameter in their configuration.
----

.Example: Mathematical operator
----
The following operators and operands are supported in Drools Rule Language:

* + (addition)
* - (subtraction)
...
----

The full name of an "Operator" must be a proper noun, with each word initially
capitalized. If it includes a product name, defer to the product's capitalization
style guidelines. For example:

- Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Logging Operator
- Prometheus Operator
- etcd Operator
- Node Tuning Operator
- Cluster Version Operator

Although "containerized" is allowed, do not use "Operatorize" to refer to building
an Operator that packages an application.

NOTE: When referring generally to other Kubernetes components, such as pods, nodes, or image streams, use lowercase. When referring to a specific component, follow the capitalization of the component name and apply monospace formatting, such as "the `Pod` spec", "a `Node` object", or "an `ImageStream` resource".

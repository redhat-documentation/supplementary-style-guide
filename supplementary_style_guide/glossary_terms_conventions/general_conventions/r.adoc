Routing rules, which are written in Java or XML DSL, start with a `from` consumer endpoint, and typically end with one or more `to` producer endpoints. Between the consumer and producer endpoints, messages can enter various processors, which might transform them or redirect them to other processors or to specific producer endpoints.

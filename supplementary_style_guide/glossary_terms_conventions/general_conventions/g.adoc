[[gssapi]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] GSSAPI (noun)
*Description*: The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSSAPI, or GSS-API) allows developers to abstract how their applications protect data that is sent to peer applications. Security-service vendors can provide GSSAPI implementations of common procedure calls as libraries with their security software. These libraries present a GSSAPI-compatible interface to application writers who can write their application to use only the vendor-independent GSSAPI. With this flexibility, developers do not have to tailor their security implementations to any particular platform, security mechanism, type of protection, or transport protocol.

Kerberos is the dominant GSSAPI mechanism implementation, which allows Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Microsoft Windows Active Directory Kerberos implementations to be API compatible.

[[id-mapping]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] ID mapping (noun)
*Description*: In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SSSD can use the SID of an AD user to algorithmically generate POSIX IDs in a process called _ID mapping_. ID mapping creates a map between SIDs in AD and IDs on Linux.

* When SSSD detects a new AD domain, it assigns a range of available IDs to the new domain. Therefore, each AD domain has the same ID range on every SSSD client machine.
* When an AD user logs in to an SSSD client machine for the first time, SSSD creates an entry for the user in the SSSD cache, including a UID based on the user's SID and the ID range for that domain.
* Because the IDs for an AD user are generated in a consistent way from the same SID, the user has the same UID and GID when logging in to any Red Hat Enterprise Linux system.

*Use it*: yes

[[id-ranges]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] ID ranges (noun)
*Description*: In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, an _ID range_ is a range of ID numbers assigned to the IdM topology or a specific replica. You can use ID ranges to specify the valid range of UIDs and GIDs for new users, hosts and groups. ID ranges are used to avoid ID number conflicts. There are two distinct types of ID ranges in IdM:

* _IdM ID range_
+
Use this ID range to define the UIDs and GIDs for users and groups in the whole IdM topology. Installing the first IdM server creates the IdM ID range. You cannot modify the IdM ID range after creating it. However, you can create an additional IdM ID range, for example when the original one nears depletion.

* _Distributed Numeric Assignment (DNA) ID range_
+
Use this ID range to define the UIDs and GIDs a replica uses when creating new users. Adding a new user or host entry to an IdM replica for the first time assigns a DNA ID range to that replica. An administrator can modify the DNA ID range, but the new definition must fit within an existing IdM ID range.


Note that the IdM range and the DNA range match, but they are not interconnected. If you change one range, ensure you change the other to match.

  * Define different attribute values for different environments.
  * Replace a previously generated attribute value with a different value.

In an IdM-AD trust setup, the `Default Trust View` is an ID view applied to AD users and groups. Using the `Default Trust View`, you can define custom POSIX attributes for AD users and groups, thus overriding the values defined in AD.

Administrators can then use the `ipa-replica-install` command to install _replicas_ in addition to the first _server_ that was installed. By default, installing a replica creates a replication agreement with the IdM server from which it was created, enabling receiving and sending updates to the rest of IdM.

In 64-bit mode, Itanium is able to calculate two bundles of a maximum of three instructions at a time. In 32-bit mode, it is much slower. Decoders must first translate 32-bit instruction sets into 64-bit instruction sets, which results in extra-clock cycle use. The Itanium processor's primary use is driving large applications that require more than 4 GB of memory, such as databases, ERP, and future internet applications.

[[network-transparency]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] network transparency (noun)

*Description*: _Network transparency_ is a condition where an operating system or other service allows the user access to a remote resource through a network without needing to know if the resource is remote or local. For example, Sun Microsystems' NFS, which has become a de facto industry standard, provides access to shared files through an interface called the Virtual File System (VFS) that runs on top of the TCP/IP stack. Users can manipulate shared files as if they were stored locally on the user's hard disk.

[[node]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] node (noun)

*Description*: 1) In networks, a _node_ is a processing location. A node can be a computer or other device, such as a printer. Every node has a unique network address, sometimes called a Data Link Control (DLC) address or Media Access Control (MAC) address. In tree structures, a _node_ is a point where two or more lines meet. 2) In the context of OpenShift, a _node_ provides the runtime environments for containers. 3) In the context of OpenStack, a _node_ is a machine running a particular OpenStack service, for example, "a Networking node". Exceptions: In a virtualization use case where the machine resources are being used to host virtual machines, use "host" instead of "node", for example, "a Compute host".

[[now]]
==== image:images/caution.png[caution] now (adverb)
*Description*: In most content, you can use "now" when you mean the present time, immediately, or at once.

If your release notes are based on the templates in this guide's xref:release-notes[Release notes] section, use "with this update" rather than "now" to refer to the current release. This is because the temporal context of "now" can cause confusion in release notes that span multiple releases.

*Use it*: with caution

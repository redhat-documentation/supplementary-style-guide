*Description*: "Backtrace" is another name for "stack trace" (or "stack backtrace"), which is a report of the active stack frames (function calls) at a certain point in time during the execution of a program. The Python programming language uses the term "traceback," possibly because the stack frames are printed in the opposite order of those presented by gdb, the GNU Debugger. "Traceback" is the preferred term when referring to a Python stack trace.

[[bimodal-it]]
==== bimodal IT (noun)
*Description*: "Bimodal IT" is the Gartner phrase for the combination of traditional (mode 1 or type 1) and modern (mode 2 or type 2) IT infrastructure and resources.

"Agile" and "modern IT" can both carry an implication of "mode 2." When using those terms, be specific about the exact technology combination you mean.

== Contributing a glossary entry

Use the following template for glossary entries:

.AsciiDoc source for a new glossary entry
----
[discrete]
[[<id>]]
==== <icon> <term> (<class>)
*Description*: <description>

*Use it*: <yes/no/with caution>

*Incorrect forms*: <incorrect_form>

*See also*: xref:<another_term_id>[<another_term>]

[cols="1,2,3a",options="header"]
|===
|Replace                |With                               | Notes
|`<id>`                 |The term in lowercase.             |If the term consists of more than one word, separate them with a hyphen ("-"). Do not use spaces, capital letters, or special characters (for example, slash "/") in the ID.
|`<icon>`               |The appropriate icon related to the "Use it" field.|Possible values:

* `\image:images/yes.png[yes]`
* `\image:images/no.png[no]`
* `\image:images/caution.png[with caution]`
|`<term>`               |The term to be described.          |
|`<class>`              |The part of speech of the term.|Possible values: noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, conjunction, preposition. Use noun for acronyms or abbreviations. Leave the field empty for symbols.
|`<description>`        |The description of the term.|Use full sentences with periods. If a term is specific to a particular product, start the description with "In <product_name>,". If a term has more than one meaning, use numbers to separate them. For example: (1) <first_meaning>. (2) <second_meaning>. Add information about why we should or shouldn't use the term in this form. Alternatively, explain why the terms listed in the *Incorrect forms* field are incorrect.
|`<yes/no/with caution>`|"yes" if the term should be used.

"no" if the term should not be used.

"with caution" if the term should be used sporadically or only in certain cases.|Explain why we should or should not use the term in the *Description* field.
|`<incorrect_form>`     |The form of the term that we should not use.|If there are multiple incorrect forms, separate them with a comma (",").
|`<another_term_id>`    |The ID of another term related to this one.|Always verify that this ID already exists in the document; otherwise, it will fail to validate if the ID does not exist. Do not include a space between `<another_term_id>` and `[<another_term>]`.
|`<another_term>`       |The term related to this one.|To link to another document or a web page, replace `xref:<another_term_id>[<another_term>]` with `<link>[<name_of_the_document/web_page>]`.

.Additional glossary entry guidelines
* Do not combine two terms into one entry.

* Keep all fields, even if a field is empty. An empty field serves as a placeholder if the field is required later.

* Use quotation marks on the first occurrence of a term in the *Description* field. Do not include an abbreviation in parentheses within the quotation marks; for example, "Asynchronous Transfer Mode" (ATM) is a network technology based on transferring data in cells or packets of a fixed size.

* If the *Description* field contains more than one paragraph, only the last paragraph is displayed in the Atom linter's text. Ensure that word usage advice is contained in the last paragraph.

* Use single lines with no breaks for each paragraph. In other words, do not hard wrap at 80 characters, for example.

* If the term has a correct and an incorrect form, always use the correct form instead of `<term>` and list the incorrect form in the *Incorrect forms* field. Remember to explain why the incorrect form is incorrect in the *Description* field.

* If you want to add a term that we should not use and that does not have a correct form, use the incorrect version instead of `<term>` and add "no" to the *Use it* field. Explain why we should not use that term in the *Description* field.

* When creating IDs in accordance with the rules described in the template, the resulting IDs might be the same as those for separate entries. For example, the "kernel space" and "kernel-space" entries, or the "kB" and "KB" entries would have the same anchor tag ("kernel-space" and "kb"). If the IDs are not unique, however, it will cause an error in the document.
+
To avoid this issue, use different IDs:
+
** For entries that have different class, append:
+
*** `n` for nouns (`kernel-space-n`)
*** `v` for verbs
*** `adj` for adjectives (`kernel-space-adj`)
*** `adv` for adverbs
*** `conj` for conjunctions
*** `prep` for prepositions
+
** For different entries with the same name, for example a command and a program or a programming language of the same name, append `command` to the command ID, for example `ceph-command`.
+
** For entries that differ in spelling, for example "kB" and "KB", preserve the letter case.

== Contributing a style guideline entry

Use the following template when adding a new style guide entry:

.AsciiDoc source for a new style entry
-----
[[<id>]]
== <style_item>

<description>

.Example AsciiDoc

<example_asciidoc>

|`<id>`
|The style item in lowercase.
|If the style item consists of more than one word, separate them with a hyphen ("-"). Do not use spaces, capital letters, or special characters (for example, slash "/") in the ID.

|`<style_item>`
|The style item to be described.
|

|`<description>`
|The description of the style guidance.
|Use full sentences with periods. If applicable, add information about why this guidance is recommended.

|`<example_asciidoc>`
|An AsciiDoc example.
|Only add an AsciiDoc example if it is applicable to the style guidance.

.Additional style entry guidelines

* Do not combine multiple guidelines into one entry.

* Do not add style entries that duplicate guidance already covered by the _IBM Style_ guide.

* Avoid linking to other resources to provide the style guidance. Incorporate the guidance from other resources into the entry description.

* Add the new entry alphabetically in its appropriate category file.

* Use single lines with no breaks for each paragraph. In other words, do not hard wrap at 80 characters, for example.

* Use italics when introducing or defining a term. The following examples demonstrate the use of this guideline:
** A _host group_ is a group of one or more hosts.
** _Comma-separated values_ are a set of values in which each value is separated by a comma.

* Use double quotation marks ("") when emphasizing how to write a term. The following examples demonstrate the use of this guideline:
** Hyphenate "look-up" when using it as a modifier.
** Spell out "comma-separated values" on first use; use "CSV" thereafter.

[[camel-context]]
==== image:images/caution.png[with caution] Camel context (noun)
*Description*: In Red Hat Fuse, every _Camel application_ is based on a `CamelContext` object, which is the Camel runtime. The `CamelContext` object keeps track of and provides access to all services loaded in it, such as components, endpoints, routes, data formats, languages, and registry. In the routing context `.xml` file, the object is represented by the `<camelContext>` element, which encloses all `<route>` elements and their routing rules. In Camel DSL, `CamelContext` instantiates a new `DefaultCamelContext` in which to add and configure routes and their routing rules. Use only when referencing code (element or method), otherwise use the generic term "routing context" when talking about the application's `.xml/DSL` file or the file's routing rules.

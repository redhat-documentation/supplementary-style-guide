[[network-transparency]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] network transparency (noun)

*Description*: "Network transparency" is a condition where an operating system or other service allows the user access to a remote resource through a network without needing to know if the resource is remote or local. For example, Sun Microsystems' NFS, which has become a de facto industry standard, provides access to shared files through an interface called the Virtual File System (VFS) that runs on top of the TCP/IP stack. Users can manipulate shared files as if they were stored locally on the user's hard disk.

[[node]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] node (noun)

*Description*: 1) In networks, a _node_ is a processing location. A node can be a computer or other device, such as a printer. Every node has a unique network address, sometimes called a Data Link Control (DLC) address or Media Access Control (MAC) address. In tree structures, a _node_ is a point where two or more lines meet. 2) In the context of OpenShift, a _node_ provides the runtime environments for containers. 3) In the context of OpenStack, a _node_ is a machine running a particular OpenStack service, for example, "a Networking node". Exceptions: In a virtualization use case where the machine resources are being used to host virtual machines, use "host" instead of "node", for example, "a Compute host".

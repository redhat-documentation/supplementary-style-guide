[[kerberos-keytab]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] Kerberos keytab (noun)
*Description*: While a password is the default authentication method for a user, keytabs are the default authentication method for hosts and services.

For example, every IdM client has an `/etc/krb5.keytab` file that stores information about the `host` principal, which represents the client machine in the Kerberos realm.

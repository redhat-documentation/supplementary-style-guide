[[commands-with-root-privileges]]
== Commands requiring root privileges

Some commands require root privileges to run. Users without root privileges must first do one of the following to run such a command:

* Run `su -` to switch to the root user account.
* Preface the command with `sudo` to temporarily change their current privileges.

Use the following guidelines when you document commands that require root privileges:

* If you include a shell prompt in a sample command, always show the correct prompt for a regular user (`$`) or a user with root privileges (`#`).
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not rely solely on a shell prompt in a sample command to indicate the required privilege level to run a command.
If you include a shell prompt to indicate that a user with root privileges must run the command, also include a statement about this requirement in the step text, the introductory text, or the prerequisites.
====
+
* If a command requires a temporary switch to root privileges, use `sudo` at the beginning of the sample command syntax. If the sample command includes a shell prompt together with `sudo`, the prompt should remain `$` and not be changed to `#`.
* If multiple commands in a procedure require root privileges, add introductory content to tell the user what to do. For example, "The commands in this procedure require root privileges to run. Either run `su -` to switch to the root user or preface the commands with `sudo`."

[[ip-addresses-and-mac-addresses]]
== IP addresses and MAC addresses

Use the IP and MAC address ranges that are reserved for documentation purposes to avoid the likelihood of conflicts and confusion:

* Reserved IP address ranges: See the _IBM Style_ guide for the list of reserved IP address ranges to use in documentation.

* Reserved MAC addresses (defined in link:https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7042.html#section-2.1.2[RFC 7042]):

** For unicast: 00:00:5E:00:53:00 - 00:00:5E:00:53:FF
** For multicast: 01:00:5E:90:10:00 - 01:00:5E:90:10:FF

[[long-code-examples]]
== Long code examples

All code blocks (regardless of length) must be necessary, accurate, and helpful. Code blocks must be as copy-and-paste friendly as possible, with the exception of variables and callouts. The length of the block is irrelevant, within reason, if the code block follows these guidelines.

[[code-example-syntax-highlighting]]
== Syntax highlighting

Provide the source language if it is supported by the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal toolchain. Do not use the `bash` source language for terminal commands. It incorrectly interprets the number sign (#) as a comment instead of the prompt for a root command.

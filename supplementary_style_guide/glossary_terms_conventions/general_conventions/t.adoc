[[tls]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] TLS (noun)
*Description*: _TLS_ is an initialism for "Transport Layer Security (TLS)", and it is the successor to the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. Do not expand the abbreviation on first use.

TLS is a cryptographic protocol that uses the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) method to encrypt network traffic between two systems. PKI uses asymmetric encryption during a TLS handshake process to authenticate the connection between two systems.

Use "TLS" when referring to protocols that exchange cryptographic keys and secure network connections between two systems. Check for the latest version of the TLS protocol and, if necessary, contact a subject matter expert (SME) to verify the TLS version to note in product documentation.

Use "SSL/TLS" in high-level documentation entries, such as headings, to establish context with encryption protocols.

[[tls-handshake]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] TLS handshake (noun)
*Description*: A _TLS handshake_ is the process of a client checking the validity of a certificate on a web server for authentication purposes.

The following example demonstrates a TLS handshake process:

A client requests a certificate from a web server. On receiving the certificate, the client checks that it trusts the certificate authority (CA) that issued the certificate. If the client trusts the CA, it generates a premaster secret and encrypts it by using the web server’s public key. The client sends the encrypted value to the web server. The web server decrypts the value by using its private key. Both client and web server calculate a shared session key by using the premaster secret and other values. Both client and web server then use the session key to encrypt any sent messages during the TLS session.

[[trusted-certificate-authority]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] trusted certificate authority (noun)
*Description*: A _trusted certificate authority (CA)_ is a third-party entity that creates TLS certificates, known as CA certificates, for authentication purposes. A trusted CA is different from a self-signed certificate in that a self-signed certificate has its own private key and does not need to request a key from a public or private CA.

A web server uses its public key to obtain a certificate from a trusted CA. The web server stores this certificate in a keystore. During the TLS handshake process, a client checks the validity of the certificate for authentication purposes.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*: self-signed certificate

[[truth-maintenance-system]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] truth maintenance system (noun)
*Description*: In Red Hat Process Automation Manager, a _truth maintenance system (TMS)_ refers to the ability of the inference engine to enforce truthfulness when applying rules. The truth maintenance system uses the mechanism of truth maintenance to efficiently handle the inferred information from rules. It provides justified reasoning for each and every action taken by the inference engine and validates the conclusions of the engine. If the inference engine asserts data as a result of firing a rule, the engine uses the TMS to justify the assertion.
